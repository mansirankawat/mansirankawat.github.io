excerpt: 'With vast amounts of data collected every night by telescopes like Allen Telescope Array, there is a need for a real time system that can accurately distinguish between signals of interest from radio frequency interference. In this paper, we present our approach based on Convolutional neural networks for classification of narrow band signals. By converting the radio signals into 2D spectrogram image, the problem of signal classification can be transformed to as image classification problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CNN technique by using a simple Alexnet network with 5 convolutional layers. We also extend our work to detect signals with multiple labels simultaneously.
