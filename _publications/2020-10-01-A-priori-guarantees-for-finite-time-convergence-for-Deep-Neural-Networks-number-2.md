excerpt: 'In this paper, we perform Lyapunov based analysis of the loss function to derive an a priori upper bound on the settling time of deep neural networks. Drawing from the advances in analysis of finite-time control of non-linear systems, we provide a priori guarantees of finite-time convergence in a deterministic control theoretic setting by formulating the supervised learning framework as a control problem.'

In this paper, we perform Lyapunov based analysis of the loss function to derive an a priori upper bound on the settling time of deep neural networks. Drawing from the advances in analysis of finite-time control of non-linear systems, we provide a priori guarantees of finite-time convergence in a deterministic control theoretic setting by formulating the supervised learning framework as a control problem.
