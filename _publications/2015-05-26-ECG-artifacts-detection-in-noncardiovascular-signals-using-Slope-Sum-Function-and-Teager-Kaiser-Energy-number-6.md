excerpt: 'In this work, a new method for ECG artifacts detection from noncardiovascular physiological signals namely EEG, EOG and EMG, without the need of any additional synchronous ECG channel, is proposed. This ECG artifacts (R peaks) detection method uses Slope Sum Function and Teager Kaiser Energy operator with an adaptive threshold. The algorithm has shown improved ECG artifacts detection results as compared to that of direct application of Teager Kaiser energy operator on noncardiovascular signals.'
