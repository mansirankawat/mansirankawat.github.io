excerpt: 'With vast amounts of data collected every night by telescopes like Allen Telescope Array, there is a need for a real time system that can accurately distinguish between signals of interest from radio frequency interference. Seti Institute and IBM jointly organized a code challenge and hackathon in June 2017 to encourage efforts towards this goal using machine learning techniques. 

In this paper, we present our approach based on Convolutional neural networks for classification of narrow band signals. By converting the radio signals into 2D spectrogram image, the problem of signal classification can be transformed to as image classification problem. Deep convolutional networks are currently the state-of-art techniques in image classification.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of CNN technique by using a simple Alexnet network with 5 convolutional layers. Our approach achieved a score of 0.21 based on the logloss metric in the hackathon. We also extend our work to detect signals with multiple labels simultaneously and initial results for the same will be presented in this paper.
