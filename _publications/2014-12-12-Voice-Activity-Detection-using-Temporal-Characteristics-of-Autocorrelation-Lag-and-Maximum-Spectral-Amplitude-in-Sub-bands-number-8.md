excerpt: 'A robust voice activity detection (VAD) is a prerequisite for many speech based applications like speech recognition. We investigated two VAD techniques that use time domain and frequency domain characteristics of speech signal. The temporal characteristic of the autocorrelation lag is able to discriminate speech and nonspeech regions. In the frequency domain, peak value of the magnitude spectrum in different sub-bands is used for VAD.'
