excerpt: 'Fast Radio Burst (FRB) are high intensity bursts of radio energy lasting only a few milliseconds with large dispersion measures, suggesting extragalactic origin [1]. FRBs have gained intense interest in the astronomical community because their physical origin is not well understood, and because they may be useful as a probe of the intergalactic medium. We use deep neural networks to distinguish between Fast Radio Bursts and other astronomical or interfering signals.'
