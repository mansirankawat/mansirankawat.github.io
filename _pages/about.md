I am a third year Ph.D. student at [Mila]("https://mila.quebec/en/") and University of Montreal supervised by [Simon Lacoste-Julien](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~slacoste/).

Before joining Mila, I completed my Masters in Computer Science from Georgia Tech. 

After that, I worked as a deep learning software engineer in perception for autonomous driving group at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) for 5 years. 

I am broadly interested in theory of deep learning, optimization for games and robustness against adversarial attacks.

Currently, I am interested in understanding stability in min-max optimization especially in the context of Adversarial training using stability concepts from Control Theory.
