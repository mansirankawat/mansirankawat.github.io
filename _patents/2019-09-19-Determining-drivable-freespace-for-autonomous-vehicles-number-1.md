excerpt: 'In various examples, sensor data may be received that represents a field of view of a sensor of a vehicle located in a physical environment. The sensor data may be applied to a machine learning model that computes both a set of boundary points that correspond to a boundary dividing drivable free-space from non-drivable space in the physical environment and class labels for boundary points of the set of boundary points that correspond to the boundary. Locations within the physical environment may be determined from the set of boundary points represented by the sensor data, and the vehicle may be controlled through the physical environment within the drivable free-space using the locations and the class labels.'
